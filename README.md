## ‚öôÔ∏è Logic Highlights

The core functionality is handled in `index.js`:

- **Character Filtering:** The `generatePasswords` function dynamically updates the `charsCollection` based on the state of the Symbols and Numbers toggles, using the powerful `.filter()` array method.
- **Clipboard API:** The `copyPassword` function prioritizes the modern `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` for seamless, secure copying and includes a `document.execCommand('copy')` fallback for broader compatibility.
